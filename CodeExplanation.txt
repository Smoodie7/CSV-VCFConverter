CSV/VCF Conversion Tool - Code Explanation:

This is a detailed explanation of the code for the CSV/VCF Conversion Tool. The code is written in Python and provides a graphical 
user interface (GUI) for converting CSV files to VCF format and vice versa.

The code starts by importing the necessary libraries:

csv: Provides functionality for reading and writing CSV files.
tkinter: Used for creating the GUI and handling user interactions.
filedialog: A submodule of tkinter that provides file and directory dialog functionalities.
messagebox: A submodule of tkinter used to display error and information messages.
logging: Used for logging conversion activities and errors.
os: Provides functions for interacting with the operating system.
threading: Used to perform the file conversion process in a separate thread.
ttk: A submodule of tkinter that provides themed widget classes.
Constants
The code defines a list of encodings (ENCODINGS) that are used to detect the encoding of the input file. These encodings are 
commonly used for text files.

"Browse" Functions
The code defines two functions: browse_input_file() and browse_output_destination(). These functions are responsible for opening
file and folder dialogs to browse and select the input file and output destination folder, respectively. They use the filedialog 
module from tkinter to achieve this.

"Convert" Functions
The code defines several functions related to the conversion process:

convert_file(): This is the main function called when the "Convert" button is clicked. It retrieves the input file path and 
output destination from the GUI fields, validates them, and starts the conversion process in a separate thread.
perform_conversion(): This function is executed in a separate thread. It performs the actual file conversion based on 
the selected input file, output destination, and format. It also handles exceptions, updates the progress bar, and displays 
completion or error messages.
get_output_file_path(): This function generates the output file path by appending a counter to the filename if a file with the 
same name already exists in the output destination folder.
convert_vcf_to_csv(): This function converts a VCF file to a CSV file. It reads the VCF file, extracts the data, and writes it
to a CSV file using the csv module.
convert_csv_to_vcf(): This function converts a CSV file to a VCF file. It reads the CSV file, extracts the data, and writes it
to a VCF file.
detect_encoding(): This function detects the encoding of a file by trying different encodings from the ENCODINGS list. If the 
encoding is not detected, it prompts the user to enter the encoding manually.
GUI
The code sets up the graphical user interface (GUI) using tkinter. It creates a window (root) and adds various GUI elements such 
as labels, text entry fields, buttons, and checkboxes.

input_file_label, input_file_entry, and input_file_browse_btn are used to handle the input file selection.
output_destination_label, output_destination_entry, and output_destination_browse_btn are used to handle the output destination 
folder selection.
log_checkbox is a checkbox that allows the user to enable or disable logging.
convert_btn is the button that triggers the conversion process.
The grid() function is used to position the GUI elements within the window.
Running the Application
The code calls the mainloop() function to start the GUI event loop, which listens for user interactions and responds accordingly.

When the user clicks the "Convert" button, the convert_file() function is called, initiating the conversion process. The conversion 
process is executed in a separate thread using the threading module to prevent blocking the GUI.

Logging
If the user checks the "Enable Logs" checkbox, the code enables logging using the logging module. Log messages are written to a file 
named "logs.txt" in the same directory as the script.

Error Handling
The code includes error handling to catch and display any exceptions that occur during the conversion process. If an error occurs, 
an error message box is displayed using the messagebox module.

Limitations
The code has certain limitations:

It assumes that the CSV file has a header row containing column names.
It expects the CSV file to be well-formed with proper delimiters and formatting.
It expects the VCF file to be well-formed with valid VCF format syntax.
Make sure to validate the input files and ensure they conform to the expected formats to avoid any issues during conversion.

That's a high-level explanation of the CSV/VCF Conversion Tool code. Feel free to dive into the code and make any modifications 
or enhancements as needed.

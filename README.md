# CSV/VCF Conversion Tool ðŸ”§

This program is a simple **CSV/VCF conversion tool** implemented using **Python** and **Tkinter** (only built-in modules). It allows you to convert files between CSV (Comma-Separated Values) and VCF (vCard) formats.

## Features âœ¨

- Supports conversion from CSV to VCF and from VCF to CSV.
- Provides a user-friendly graphical interface for easy file selection and conversion.
- Detects the encoding of the input file automatically or prompts the user to specify the encoding if it cannot be detected.
- Handles naming conflicts when saving the output file by appending a counter to the filename.
- Enables logging of conversion operations if desired.

## How to Use 

**1.** Select the input file by clicking the "Browse" button next to the "Input File" field. (You can choose either a CSV file or a VCF file.)

**2.** Select the output destination folder by clicking the "Browse" button next to the "Output Destination" field.

**3.** Optionally, check the "Enable Logs" checkbox to enable logging of conversion operations.

**4.** Click the "Convert" button to start the conversion process.

**5.** If the conversion is successful, a message box will be displayed with a completion message.

*(If an error occurs during the conversion, an error message box will be displayed with the details of the error.)*

Feel free to customize and enhance this program to fit your specific requirements!

*Note: The program provides a predefined list of common encodings, but if the encoding of the input file cannot be automatically detected, it will prompt you to enter the encoding manually.*
